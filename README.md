top500vis
=========

Developers: Nick McNutt & Blake Haugen

We plan to create a webpage using javascript to tell a visual story about
the Top 500 supercomputer list that has been compiled every June and November
since 1993.

This is a final project for a Visualization course (COSC 557) at the 
University of Tennessee Knoxville.
