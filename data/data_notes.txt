Some notes about the filtered data

- Rmax column has been renamed to RMax across the data set for consistency 
- Rpeak column has been renamed to RPeak across the data set for consistency 

- Accelerator cores (11/11) renamed to Accelerator/Co-Processor Cores for
  consistency

- Accelerator (6/11-11/11) renamed to Acellerator/Co-Processor for consistency

- Effeciency (%) (11/11-6/12) renamed to Efficiency (%) for consistency

- Processors was used from 6/93-6/08
    Cores was used from 11/08-6/11 (adapted for multicore era)
    Total Cores has been used from 11/11 to present (adapted to accelerator era)
    All of these were renamed to Total Cores in the final data set

After the data cleaning is complete, all of the files are combined to create the
clean data file.  Obviously there are some columns missing in parts of the file
as well as some "None", "NaN" and "0" entries.  The final file is pretty large
right now but this can be reduced for optimization in the future.
